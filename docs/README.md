# Getting Started

Purgatory is a Symfony bundle for HTTP cache invalidation, designed to automatically generate and send cache purge
requests to HTTP cache backends like Symfony's HTTP cache or Varnish. It leverages Doctrine events to track changes in
entities and generates URLs that need purging based on configured routes.

## Why URL-based Invalidation?

This bundle uses URL-based invalidation instead of tag-based invalidation due to the following reasons:

1. **Performance Concerns**: Varnish's tag-based invalidation can lead to slow responses when multiple URLs are
   invalidated simultaneously.
1. **Header Size Limitations**: Tags are typically passed through HTTP headers, which have size limitations. This means
   not all tags may fit within the header limits.
1. **Cost Implications**: Some CDN providers charge extra for tag-based invalidation, making URL-based purging a more
   cost-effective solution.

## Supported Backends

The bundle includes built-in support for [Symfony HTTP Cache](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_cache.html) and a
basic [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/) implementation. Each backend is implemented through
the [`PurgerInterface`][0].

It also provides a `void` purger, which can be used during development when cache purging is not needed. The `void`
purger simply ignores all purge requests, making it ideal for non-production environments. Additionally, an `in-memory`
purger is included, specifically designed for testing purposes.

For advanced use cases, you can create [custom purgers](custom-purgers.md) to integrate with any custom or
third-party HTTP cache backend that fits your project requirements.

### Configuring Symfony's HTTP Cache

Configure Symfony's HTTP Cache according to
the [official documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_cache.html#symfony-reverse-proxy).

To use the Symfony purger, add the following configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
purgatory:
    purger: symfony
```

### Configuring Varnish Cache

To enable Varnish to support `PURGE` requests, add the following example configuration to your VCL file. You may need to
customize it based on your specific Varnish setup:

```vcl
acl purge {
    "localhost";
    "172.16.0.0"/12; # Common Docker IP range, adjust as needed
    # Add more whitelisted IPs here
}

sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (client.ip !~ purge) {
            return (synth(405, "Not allowed."));
        }
        return (purge);
    }
}
```

To use the Varnish purger, add the following configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
purgatory:
    purger: varnish
```

Optionally, you can specify a list of Varnish hosts:

```yaml
# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
purgatory:
    purger:
        name: varnish
        hosts:
            - varnish1.example.com
            - varnish2.example.com
            - varnish3.example.com
```

If no hosts are specified, the bundle will use the host from the URL.

## Configuring Asynchronous Processing

Purge requests can be processed asynchronously using
the [Symfony Messenger component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html). To enable asynchronous processing,
simply set up the transport:

```yaml
# config/packages/messenger.yaml
framework:
    messenger:
        transports:
            async: '%env(MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN)%'

# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
purgatory:
    messenger:
        transport: async
```

If needed, you can limit the number of purge requests included in each message by setting a `batch_size`:

```yaml
# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
purgatory:
    messenger:
        transport: async
        batch_size: 10
```

To start processing purge requests asynchronously, run the following command:

```shell
bin/console messenger:consume async
```

## How It Works

The bundle listens to **Doctrine** lifecycle events (`postUpdate`, `postRemove`, `postPersist`) to automatically detect
when entities are modified, created, or deleted. When these changes are flushed to the database, the bundle steps in to
process them.

The bundle uses **purge subscriptions**, which are predefined rules that associate specific entities and their
properties with corresponding routes and route parameters. These subscriptions help identify which content should be
purged based on changes to the entities.

To determine which routes need purging, the bundle relies on **route providers**. These services evaluate the purge
subscriptions and determine the relevant routes and parameters based on the changes detected in the entities. When
dealing with updates, the route provider returns the same route twice, once with the old parameters and once with the
new parameters.

Using this information, the bundle generates the URLs that need to be purged. It then sends these purge requests to the
configured purger, which clears the cached content for those URLs.

You can also create [custom route providers](custom-route-providers.md) to define additional routes for specific
entities and properties, giving you greater control over purging behavior in more complex scenarios.

## Configuring Purge Subscriptions

Purge subscriptions can be configured using the [`#[PurgeOn]`][1] attribute. Controllers using this attribute **MUST**
be registered as services.

You can also configure purge subscriptions [using YAML](purge-subscriptions-using-yaml.md). This is particularly
useful if you have routes without an associated controller or action.

### Basic Example

In this example, the post details page is purged whenever any change is made to the `Post` entity:

```php
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Attribute\PurgeOn;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Attribute\Route;

class PostController
{
    #[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
    #[PurgeOn(Post::class)]
    public function detailsAction(Post $post)
    {
    }
}
```

Here, the `id` property is automatically mapped to the route parameter with the same name.

You can also apply this to a controller class using the `__invoke` method:

```php
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Attribute\PurgeOn;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Attribute\Route;

#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class)]
class PostDetailsController
{
    public function __invoke(Post $post)
    {
    }
}
```

In this case, the subscription is added at the class level, making it suitable for single-action controllers.

### Inheritance and Subscriptions

When using inheritance mapping, any subscription to a parent entity automatically applies to all child entities as well.

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

#[ORM\MappedSuperclass]
class Animal {}

#[ORM\Entity]
class Cat extends Animal {}

#[ORM\Entity]
class Dog extends Animal {}
```

For example, if you define a purge subscription for the `Animal` entity, it will automatically apply to both `Cat` and
`Dog` entities:

```php
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Attribute\PurgeOn;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Attribute\Route;

class AnimalController
{
    #[Route('/animal/{id<\d+>}', name: 'animal_details', methods: 'GET')]
    #[PurgeOn(Animal::class)]
    public function detailsAction(Animal $animal)
    {
    }
}
```

In this case, changes to `Cat`, `Dog`, or any future subclasses of `Animal` will trigger the purging of the
corresponding route. This allows you to define common purging behavior for all related entities by configuring it once
on the parent class.

### Explicit Mapping of Route Parameters

If the parameter names differ, you have to explicitly map them:

```php
#[Route('/post/{postId<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, routeParams: ['postId' => 'id'])]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

For more advanced examples of mapping route parameters, see the [dedicated section](complex-route-params.md).

### Targeting Specific Properties

By default, all properties are subscribed to purging. You can customize this by specifying which properties to watch:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, target: ['title', 'text'])]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

In this example, the purge will only occur if the `title` or `text` properties change.

### Targeting Specific Methods

In addition to properties, you can specify methods that define which properties should be watched:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, target: 'titleAndAuthor')]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

To associate specific properties with a method, use the [`#[TargetedProperties]`][2] attribute on your entity method:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Attribute\TargetedProperties;

#[ORM\Entity]
class Post
{
    // ...

    #[TargetedProperties('title', 'author')]
    public function getTitleAndAuthor(): string
    {
        return $this->title.', '.$this->author->getFullName();
    }
}
```

In this example, the purge will only occur if the `title` or `author` properties change.

### Targeting `OneTo*` Relations

For `OneToMany` or `OneToOne` relations, the bundle automatically creates inverse subscriptions for related entities.
This means that changes in the related entity will also trigger a purge for the primary entity's routes.

For example:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, target: 'author')]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

In this case, if any property of the `Author` entity changes, the post details page will be purged. This automatic
subscription simplifies the purging logic by handling relationships between entities without additional manual
configuration.

### Targeting Embeddables

When targeting an embeddable, the bundle subscribes to all properties of the embeddable by default. This is useful when
the embeddable encapsulates multiple related fields that should trigger purging as a group.

For example:

```php
#[Route('/author/{id<\d+>}', name: 'author_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Author::class, target: 'address')]
public function detailsAction(Author $author)
{
}
```

Here, the `address` target subscribes to all properties within the `Address` embeddable class. If any property within
`Address` changes (such as `street`, `city`, or `postalCode`), the author details page will be purged.

### Using Serialization Groups

You can also specify which Symfony
Serializer [serialization groups](https://symfony.com/doc/current/serializer.html#using-serialization-groups-attributes)
to use:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, target: new ForGroups('common'))]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

In this case, the purge will occur for all properties that are part of the `common` serialization group or are listed as
`#[TargetedProperties]` on a method with that group:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Attribute\TargetedProperties;
use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Attribute\Groups;

#[ORM\Entity]
class Post
{
    // ...

    #[Groups('common')]
    #[TargetedProperties('title', 'author')]
    public function getTitleAndAuthor(): string
    {
        return $this->title.', '.$this->author->getFullName();
    }
}
```

### Adding Conditional Logic with Expression Language

[Symfony's ExpressionLanguage component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/expression_language.html) can be
used to add conditions that must be met for the purge to occur. In these expressions, the entity is available as the
`obj` variable:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, if: 'obj.upvotes > 3000')]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

In this example, the purge will only occur if the post has more than 3,000 upvotes.

You can also add [custom Expression Language functions](custom-expression-language-functions.md).

### Adding Conditional Logic with Closures

Starting with [PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/releases/8.5/en.php), closures can be used in attributes, so the same
condition can be written in plain PHP instead of an expression. The closure receives the entity as its only argument:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, if: static function (Post $post): bool {
    return $post->upvotes > 3000;
})]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

This feature requires the [`symfony/polyfill-deepclone`](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill-deepclone) package:

```sh
composer require symfony/polyfill-deepclone
```

For better performance you can instead install the [`symfony/deepclone`](https://github.com/symfony/php-ext-deepclone) PHP extension.

The closure must:

- have exactly one parameter, typed with the subscribed entity class or one of its parents,
- declare a non-nullable `bool` return type.


### Using Purge on Actions with Multiple Routes

By default, the attribute generates URLs for all routes associated with the action. You can limit this to one or more
specific routes:

```php
#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[Route('/blog-post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details_old', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, route: 'post_details')]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

In this example, only the `post_details` route will be purged.

This is useful when dealing with multiple routes that use different route parameters. For example:

```php
#[Route('/posts', name: 'post_list', methods: 'GET')]
#[Route('/posts/{category}', name: 'post_list_by_category', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, routeParams: ['category' => 'category.slug'])]
public function listAction(#[MapEntity(mapping: ['category' => 'slug'])] ?Category $category = null)
{
}
```

Changes to `Post` would result in two URLs being generated: `/posts?category=<categorySlug>` and
`/posts/<categorySlug>`. Because of how Symfony's router handles extra route parameters, the first URL includes an
unexpected query parameter.

To avoid this, define two separate purge subscriptions, one for each route:

```php
#[Route('/posts', name: 'post_list', methods: 'GET')]
#[Route('/posts/{category}', name: 'post_list_by_category', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, route: 'post_list')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, routeParams: ['category' => 'category.slug'], route: 'post_list_by_category')]
public function listAction(#[MapEntity(mapping: ['category' => 'slug'])] ?Category $category = null)
{
}
```

This ensures that the correct URL is generated for each route, without extra query parameters.

### Limiting by Action Type

You can also limit the purging to a specific action as defined in the [`Action`][3] enum:

```php
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Listener\Enum\Action;

#[Route('/post/{id<\d+>}', name: 'post_details', methods: 'GET')]
#[PurgeOn(Post::class, action: Action::Update)]
public function detailsAction(Post $post)
{
}
```

Now, the purge will only occur when the entity is updated, but not when it is created or deleted.

## Testing

For testing purposes, you can use the `in-memory` purger, which simulates purging without interacting with external
cache services. This allows you to verify your purging logic in a controlled environment. To simplify your tests, you
can also utilize the [`InteractsWithPurgatory`][4] trait.

To configure the `in-memory` purger specifically for your test environment, add the following configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
when@test:
    purgatory:
        purger: in-memory
```

To write tests, use the `InteractsWithPurgatory` trait in your test class, which provides helper methods to verify
purged URLs and clear the in-memory purger:

```php
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\KernelTestCase;
use Sofascore\PurgatoryBundle\Test\InteractsWithPurgatory;

class PurgeTest extends KernelTestCase
{
    use InteractsWithPurgatory;

    // ...

    public function testPurgePost()
    {
        // Create and persist a new Post entity
        $post = new Post();
        $post->title = 'Title';
        $post->text = 'Text';

        $this->entityManager->persist($post);
        $this->entityManager->flush();

        // Assert that the URL for the post has been purged
        self::assertUrlIsPurged('/post/title');

        // Clear the in-memory purger for the next set of assertions
        self::clearPurger();

        // Update the Post entity and flush the changes
        $post->title = 'Title New';

        $this->entityManager->flush();

        // Assert that both the old and new URLs have been purged
        self::assertUrlIsPurged('/post/title');
        self::assertUrlIsPurged('/post/title-new');
    }
}
```

## Debugging

The bundle includes integration with the [Symfony Profiler](https://symfony.com/doc/current/profiler.html) to help you
monitor and troubleshoot purge requests. To enable this integration, add the following configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/purgatory.yaml
purgatory:
    profiler_integration: true
```

Additionally, you can use the `purgatory:debug` command to display information about all configured purge subscriptions.
This command provides insights into which routes and parameters are associated with your entities.
